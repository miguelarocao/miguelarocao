## What I've Been Up To

Most recently at **Zendesk**, where I led the team that launched AI Agents Essentials — RAG-powered customer support automation that scaled to 10k+ bot deployments resolving millions of customer queries. Also built semantic search infrastructure handling 2M+ daily queries.

Before that: **Google** (ad conversion ML), **Blue Prism AI Labs** (intelligent document processing, filed international patent), **Caltech**, **McGill**.
